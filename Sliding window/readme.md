# Sliding Window Technique

## Overview
The **sliding window technique** is a powerful approach for solving problems involving **subarrays or substrings** of contiguous elements. Instead of recalculating results for every possible subarray, we maintain a **window (range of indices)** that moves (slides) across the array or string while updating results efficiently.

---

## When to Use Sliding Window?
- When the problem involves **subarrays/substrings** (contiguous elements).
- When you need to find:
  - Maximum or minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements.
  - Longest/shortest substring with certain conditions.
  - Number of substrings/subarrays that meet a specific criterion.

Sliding Window is a powerful technique to solve subarray/substring problems efficiently.  
There are **two types** of sliding window approaches:
1. **Fixed (Static) Size Sliding Window**  
2. **Variable Size Sliding Window**

---

## **1. Fixed (Static) Size Sliding Window**

### **Concept**
- The window size is **constant (k)**.
- Used for problems like:
  - Maximum/Minimum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
  - Maximum/Minimum average of `k` elements.
  - First negative number in every `k` size window.

---

### **General Steps**
1. Start with two pointers `left` and `right`.
2. Expand the `right` pointer until the window reaches size `k`.
3. Process the current window (e.g., update the answer).
4. Slide the window by incrementing `left` (removing the effect of the leftmost element).

# Variable Size Sliding Window Template

## **Concept**
The **variable size sliding window** technique is used when:
- We need to find the **longest/shortest subarray/substring** with certain properties.
- The window expands and contracts dynamically based on conditions.

---

## **General Steps**
1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the current window.
2. Use a data structure (like `map`, `set`, `vector`, or just a sum counter) to store the window state.
3. Expand the `right` pointer step by step.
4. If the current window violates a condition, **shrink** it by moving the `left` pointer until it satisfies the condition.
5. Update the **answer** (e.g., max/min length, sum) whenever the condition is satisfied.
