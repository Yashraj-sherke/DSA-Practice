A curated list of essential array problems for DSA placement preparation. Practice these to build strong problem-solving skills in arrays.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Basic Operations (Start Here)
- Find the largest element in an array
- Find the smallest element in an array
- Print the array in reverse order
- Sum of all elements in the array
- Count even and odd numbers
- Search an element in array (Linear Search)
- Check if array is sorted
- Remove duplicates (Sorted Array - Inplace)
- Remove duplicates (Unsorted - Using Set)
- Count frequency of an element

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Two Pointers & Swapping
- Reverse the array in-place
- Move all zeros to end
- Segregate 0s and 1s in array
- Find second largest element
- Swap first and last element
- Check if array is palindrome
- Left Rotate the array by 1
- Right Rotate the array by 1
- Cyclically rotate by k places
- Maximum product of two numbers

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Sorting & Searching Based
- Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s (Dutch National Flag)
- Find missing number in 1 to N
- Find duplicate number
- Intersection of two arrays
- Union of two arrays
- Find majority element (> n/2 times)
- Find k-th smallest element (Sorting)
- Merge two sorted arrays
- Find median of two sorted arrays
- Check if two arrays are equal (after sorting)

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Prefix Sum, Subarrays & Sliding Window
- Maximum sum of subarray of size k (Fixed sliding window)
- Longest subarray with given sum
- Subarray with sum 0 exists or not
- Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Sum)
- Count subarrays with given XOR
- Check for pair with given sum
- Count number of subarrays with sum divisible by K
- Find smallest positive missing number
- Maximum difference between two elements
- Maximum consecutive 1s in binary array

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Advanced Ideas (Rotation, Bit Manipulation, Frequency)
- Check if array is sorted and rotated âœ…
- Rotate matrix by 90 degrees
- Product of array except self
- Minimum number of jumps to reach end
- Trap Rain Water problem
- Buy & Sell Stock to maximize profit
- Longest Mountain in array
- Missing and repeating number
- Leaders in array (every greater on right)
- Rearrange array in max/min form alternately
