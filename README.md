## 📚 Array DSA – Quick Tips & Tricks

### 🧠 Patterns to Master

### Two Pointers
Do pointers use karte hain ek array/list ke different ends pe (ya kabhi dono ek hi jagah se start karte hain) — mostly sorted array ke problems mein use hota hai.

### Sliding Window
Ek fixed-size ya variable-size ka window banate hain array pe, aur us window ko slide karte hain bina poore array ko baar-baar scan kiye.

### Prefix Sum 
Ek auxiliary array banate hain jisme har index tak ka cumulative sum hota hai. Isse range queries fast ho jaati hain.

### Hashing
Fast lookup, counting, or storage ke liye hashing use hoti hai — mostly unordered_map/set in C++.

### Sorting + Binary Search
Data ko sort karke, binary search (log n) use karte hain fast searching ke liye. Many problems reduce to this combo.

### Kadane’s Algorithm
Subarray ka maximum sum nikalna in O(n) time.

### Dutch National Flag Algorithm (3 Pointers)
Array ko 3 parts mein segregate karte ho using 3 pointers.

### 🚀 Handy Tricks
- 🧮 **Kadane’s Algorithm** – Max subarray sum in O(n).
- 🔁 **Dutch National Flag** – Sort 0s, 1s, 2s in one pass.
- 🔢 **Difference Array** – Efficient multiple range updates.
- 🧾 **Frequency Map** – Use for majority elements, counting pairs.
- 📍 **Edge Case Handling** – Check for empty arrays, single elements, negatives, large input sizes.

### 🧩 Common Problem Types
- ✅ Two Sum / 3Sum / 4Sum
- ✅ Subarray with given sum (positive/negative)
- ✅ Maximum sum subarray (Kadane’s)
- - ✅ Move zeroes to end / Rotate array
- ✅ Longest consecutive sequence
- ✅ Merge intervals
- ✅ Stock buy and sell (1, 2, infinite transactions)
